# Drivers-Alertness-Prediction

Driving while distracted, fatigued or drowsy may lead to accidents. Activities that divert the driver's attention from the road ahead, such as engaging in a conversation with other passengers in the car, making or receiving phone calls, sending or receiving text messages, eating while driving or events outside the car may cause driver distraction. Fatigue and drowsiness can result from driving long hours or from lack of sleep.

The objective of this challenge is to design a detector/classifier that will detect whether the driver is alert or not alert, employing any combination of vehicular, environmental and driver physiological data that are acquired while driving
